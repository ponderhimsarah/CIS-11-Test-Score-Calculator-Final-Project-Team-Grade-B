## What does the program do?

In short, this program is a calculator programmed in the LC-3 language that takes 5 test scores and calculates the maximum, minimum, and average of the grades. It also displays a corresponding letter grade next to each test score. 

## How is this program helpful?

This program is meant to be helpful by providing an easy, user-friendly way to perceive grades in a new light by calculating the maximum, minimum, and average of 5 grades provided by a student. In doing so, it could help alleviate a student's stress. 

## How can I used this program?

To use this program, open or copy/past the contents of the .asm file into an LC-3 editor. Next, assemble the file and open it (.obj file) in an LC-3 simulator. Finally, run the program and have fun!
